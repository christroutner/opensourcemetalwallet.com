# Introduction

A 'paper wallet' is a catch-all term for any physical object with a key pair (private key and public payment address) showing on it. The most obvious paper wallets are ones you can print onto paper, like [this one](https://paperwallet.fullstack.cash/). But often plastic and metal are used for their durable qualities. This website provides information centered around engraving 'paper wallets' onto plastic and metal with widely available laser engravers.

## Advantages of Paper Wallets

- Paper wallets are valuable because they turn cryptocurrency into a physical object. Humans are very intuitive and very good at protecting physical object.

- They make great gifts and an easy way to onboard the crypto-curious. The receiver does not need any knowledge, an app, or even electricity. You just give it to them like you'd hand them a business card. They are free to explore more about cryptocurrency on their own time and terms, but now they have a little skin in the game.

## Disadvantages of Paper Wallets

- Anyone who obtains a picture of your private key can take your cryptocurrency.

- If you did not make the paper wallet yourself, you are trusting someone to do that for you. They may be able to take your cryptocurrency.

**For the reasons above, it is never appropriate to store large amounts of cryptocurrency on a paper wallet that you did not generate yourself.**
