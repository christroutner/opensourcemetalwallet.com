# Paper Wallets

Traditionally, 'paper wallets' are printed on paper using a desktop printer. You can conveniently generate and print as many paper wallets as you'd like using [this paper wallet app](https://paperwallet.fullstack.cash/).

While a web app is convenient, it is much more secure to generate your paper wallets from your own computer, and not trust the developers of web apps. [You can download the source code for the above web app here](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/paper-wallet), and run the same software on your own computer. If you are a JavaScript developer, you can inspect the code and learn how it works.
