# Recover Funds

Cryptocurrency on a paper wallet is not directly spendable. You need to first recover the funds by transferring the cryptocurrency into a wallet app. The act of recovering funds is called 'Sweeping'.

## Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

You can use these wallets to sweep BCH from a paper wallet:

- [Bitcoin.com Wallet](https://wallet.bitcoin.com/) is probably the easiest wallet to use. It is available for both Android and iPhone. Click the QR-code icon in the upper-right corner to scan the QR code representing the private key.

- [Wallet.FullStack.cash](https://bchn-wallet.fullstack.cash) is a convenient web wallet. [This video](https://youtu.be/QW9xixHaEJE) shows how to use [wallet.fullstack.cash](https://bchn-wallet.fullstack.cash). You will need to scan the QR code representing the private key with a QR scanner app, then paste the private key information into the the *Sweep* view of the web app.

- [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org/) is a desktop app that is also capable of sweeping funds from a private key.
